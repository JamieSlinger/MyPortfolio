            <h2>Welcome to my portfolio.</h2>
            <p className="p1">
              Iâ€™m Jamie, a 22-year-old Btech Computer Engineer graduate living in
              Cape Town and currently working part time at Woolworths. Working at
              Woolworths taught me the power of teamwork and how much a great team
              can accomplish together, it also improved my interpersonal skills.
              During my studies I was exposed to many programming languages,
              databases, electronic communications and more. In my spare time I
              enjoy spending time with my family and training at the gym. Training
              at the gym has been very beneficial to me because it requires
              discipline and is goal oriented. Being physically active during the
              day also increases energy levels as well as self-esteem. It is also a
              great place to meet new people with similar goals as your own, which
              creates a very supportive environment.
